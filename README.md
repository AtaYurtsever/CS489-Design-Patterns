# CS489 Design Patterns Tutorial Resources
You can access the example code in the code folder

## How to Study
### Books 
- Design Patterns in Java
  - I believe this book has the best structure. It shows codes and examples all written java. Simple to understand talks about all important aspects. Definitely the go to handbook of mine.
- Desing Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software Development
  - First book that defines the design patterns. Some patterns are explained with less detail. But overall this must one of the first resources you need to look out for when learning about design patterns
- Head First Design Patterns
  - This is our coursebook thus it is the best place to study for exams. The way it teaches is not suitable for me, other two books give more concrete examples.
  
### Papers
Unlike most other things in computer science design patterns are first defined in the book not in a paper, so there is no initial paper for design patterns. Below are some of my favourite papers on the subject.
- Learning to  Listen for Design 
  - This is the paper that the first part of our lecture is based on. It touches some very interesting points. Especially Voice and Hearing chapters are really fun to read. 
- Design Patterns Generic Models
  - Simplest paper of all. It goes over all of the design patterns in a simple fashion. Splits these patterns into groups in a different way than the other resources.
- Composite Design Patterns
  - Very quick read that explains how to create composite patterns that consist of more than one design pattern.
- Design Patterns Between Programming and Engineering
  - This pattern very wonderfully gives an overview for the use of design patterns. Again a very quick read.
  
### Videos and Podcasts
- [GOTO 2014 • Root Cause Analysis of some Faults in Design Patterns • Ralph E. Johnson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImUcJctyUQ0)
  - Ralph Johnson is one of the writers of the Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software Development. In this talk he is talking about modern advances in programming that some of their defined design patterns cannot keep up. It is beautiful retrospective talk.
- [Erich Gamma Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8-KPJS2Bjw)
  - Erich Gamma is another one of the writers of the Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software Developent  In this podcast he generally talks about his career but at the start they talk about his greatest work design patterns. All of the podcast is really fun to listen.
  
### Codes
Codes we have written in the class can be found inside the codes folder. WODP folder includes the implementation without the design patterns, WDP includes the implementation with the design patterns.
To run the codes you need the processing ide which can be get from [here](https://processing.org/download). You can learn more about the processing from [here](https://processing.org/tutorials/)
